# Original-CS330-Final-Project
This is the CS330 Final Project prior to adding my enhancements that were outilined in my example code reivew. The code review can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pwx_MJLvxNQ).

This project was originally for the CS 330 Computation Graphics and Visualization final project. This project was started in October of 2021 and was one of the 
first complex programs that I had to work on. This program utilizes several other sources of code created by others and successfully puts them together to 
achieve the intended result. By doing this with consistency, an easy-to-follow structure, and comments that will allow any coder to understand the program’s 
logic, I have demonstrated abilities in Software Engineering and Design. Specifically, the structure of the program allows for future objects to be easily 
added with the intention of adding detail to the scene. I demonstrated this through my original code and it’s enhancements, which include: two new hedges, the 
Sun revolving around the origin, a re-worked center road object, a skybox, refined comments, redundant code removal, style consistency refined, and security 
modifications. The enhanced code can be found [here](https://github.com/Robert-Livengood/CS330-Computational-Graphics-and-Visualizations).
